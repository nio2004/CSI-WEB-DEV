Assignment: Drag and Drop Puzzle Game
Objective:
Create a web-based puzzle game using React that allows users to drag and drop pieces to complete an image or a pattern. This assignment will help you practice your React skills, particularly in managing state, components, and handling user interactions.

Requirements:
1. Game Interface:
Create a game board with a grid-like structure.
Choose an image or a pattern (e.g., a simple geometric design) that needs to be assembled using puzzle pieces. You can use CSS to style the puzzle pieces to resemble the selected image or pattern.
Divide the image or pattern into multiple puzzle pieces, at least 9 pieces.
Initially, display the puzzle pieces in a randomized order on the game board.
2. Drag and Drop Functionality:
Implement drag and drop functionality to allow users to move the puzzle pieces around the game board.
When a user clicks and holds a puzzle piece, it should become draggable.
Users should be able to drag a puzzle piece and drop it onto a target area on the board to assemble the complete image or pattern.
Ensure that the puzzle pieces snap into place when dropped in the correct position.
3. Game Logic:
Implement game logic to check whether the puzzle pieces are in the correct order to complete the image or pattern.
Provide feedback to the user when they successfully complete the puzzle (e.g., display a congratulatory message).
Allow users to reset the game if they want to start over.
4. Additional Features (Optional):
Implement a timer to record how long it takes the user to complete the puzzle.
Include a feature to shuffle the puzzle pieces at any time.
Add a scoring system based on the time taken and moves made.

Assignment: Memory Card Flip Game
Objective:
Create an interactive memory card flip game using React. This project will help you apply your React skills to build a fun and challenging game that tests the player's memory and concentration.

Requirements:
1. Game Interface:
Create a grid of cards, with the cards initially face-down.
Each card should have a hidden image on one side and be blank on the other side.
You can use CSS to style the cards creatively.
2. Game Logic:
Implement game logic where the player needs to match pairs of cards with the same hidden image.
When the player clicks on a card, it should flip over, revealing the hidden image.
The player should be able to flip two cards at a time.
If the two flipped cards match, they should stay face-up.
If the two flipped cards do not match, they should flip back face-down after a brief delay.
3. Game Win Condition:
Define a win condition where the player has successfully matched all pairs of cards.
Display a congratulatory message when the player wins the game.
4. Game Reset:
Allow the player to reset the game if they wish to start over.
Shuffle the cards to ensure a different arrangement each time the game is reset.
5. Additional Features (Optional):
Implement a timer to record how long it takes the player to complete the game.
Add a scoring system based on the time taken and the number of moves made.
Create different difficulty levels by varying the grid size and the number of unique card pairs.
