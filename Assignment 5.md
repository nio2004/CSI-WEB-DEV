NodeJS and  ExpressJS - 
Assignment: File Upload and Download Website

Guidelines - 
•	It is compulsory to use any 2 types of databases.
•	  
•	It is compulsory to integrate basic (register/login) user authentication. 
•	The website should support almost all types of FILES.

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to create a file upload and download server using Node.js and Express.js. Students will learn how to implement secure file upload and download functionality, handle file storage, and implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access to files.

Instructions:
You are tasked with building a file upload and download server with the following features:

File Upload:

Users should be able to upload files to the server using a web interface.
Implement restrictions on the types and sizes of files that can be uploaded.
Provide feedback to users on the status of their uploads.

File Storage:
Store uploaded files securely on the server, ensuring that they cannot be directly accessed via URL.
Organize files in a structured manner, such as by user or category.

File Download:
Allow users to view a list of files they have uploaded.
Users should be able to download their own files but not files uploaded by other users.

Security Measures:
Implement authentication to ensure that only authorized users can upload and download files.
Use secure file naming conventions to prevent path traversal attacks.
Implement access controls to prevent unauthorized users from accessing files.

User Interface:
Design a user-friendly web interface for uploading and downloading files.
Include appropriate feedback and error messages for users.

User Registration/Login:

Implement user registration and login functionality to associate uploaded files with specific users.

File Versioning:
Allow users to upload multiple versions of the same file, and implement version control for files.

File Metadata:
Enable users to add metadata (e.g., descriptions, tags) to their uploaded files.
