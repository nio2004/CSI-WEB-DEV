React - Routers, State Management, API 
Assignment: Stock Market Tracker with React, API Integration, State Management, and Routing

Objective:
Build a Stock Market Tracker web application using React that allows users to view real-time stock prices and charts. This assignment will assess your proficiency in React, API integration, state management, and routing.

Requirements:

Project Setup:
Create a new React application using create-react-app or your preferred React setup.
Set up React Router for handling different routes within the application.

API Integration:
Integrate a financial API (e.g., Alpha Vantage) to fetch real-time stock data.
Fetch data for a list of stocks and individual stock details.
Handle API requests and responses appropriately, including error handling.
State Management:

Use a state management library of your choice (e.g., Redux, MobX, React Context API) to manage the application's state.
Store and manage fetched stock data, including symbols, names, current prices, and historical price data.
Implement actions and reducers (if using Redux) to update and retrieve data from the state.

Routing:
Set up routing using React Router to create the following routes:
/: The home route that displays a list of stocks.
/stock/:symbol: A route that displays detailed information about a specific stock. The :symbol parameter should represent the stock symbol.

User Interface:
Design and implement a user-friendly interface that includes:
A list of stocks with symbols, names, and current prices on the home page.
A detailed view for each stock, showing the stock's current price and a historical price chart.
A search feature to allow users to filter and find specific stocks.
Loading indicators during API requests and error messages for failed requests.
Responsive design for various screen sizes.

User Interaction:
Implement user interactions, such as clicking on a stock in the list to view its details.
Add navigation links or a menu for switching between different stock views.
Provide a smooth user experience.

Enhancements:
Consider adding advanced features like auto-refresh to keep stock data up-to-date.
Implement caching strategies to reduce the number of API requests for repeated data.

Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation of routing, state management, and API integration.
User interface design and responsiveness.
Handling of API requests, loading indicators, and error messages.
Usability and user interactions.
Code structure, organization, and documentation.
Any additional features or enhancements implemented.
