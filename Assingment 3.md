React - Hooks

Project Title: Enhanced Note-Taking App

Project Description:

In this project, you will build an enhanced note-taking application that incorporates various React hooks, including useState, useEffect, useReducer, useContext, useCallback, and more. Additionally, you will create a custom hook to manage the theme of the notes within the app.

Requirements:

Note-Taking Features:

Users should be able to create, edit, delete, and view notes.
Use the useState hook to manage the state of the notes, including the title and content of each note.
Implement a feature to display the list of notes and their details.

Theming (Custom Hook):
Create a custom hook (e.g., useTheme) to manage the theme of the note-taking app.
The theme should include options for light and dark themes.
Use the useContext hook to provide the current theme to components throughout the app.
Allow users to switch between light and dark themes using a button or toggle switch.
Apply the selected theme to the entire application, including backgrounds, text colors, and any other relevant styles.

Data Persistence:
Use the useEffect hook to save and load notes to/from local storage.
Ensure that user-created notes persist across page refreshes.

Note Actions:
Implement actions for creating, editing, and deleting notes.
Use the useReducer hook to manage state transitions for these actions.
Utilize the useCallback hook to memoize functions for better performance.

Navigation and Routing:
Implement navigation between the list of notes and individual note views using React Router or another routing solution.
Ensure that note URLs are shareable and that users can navigate directly to a specific note using its URL.

User Experience:
Focus on creating a user-friendly and responsive interface.
Include error handling and validation for note creation and editing (e.g., empty title/content).
Provide feedback to users when actions like saving, deleting, or switching themes occur.
