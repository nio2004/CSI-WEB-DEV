# Assignment 1 for CSI Web Dev Coords

Part a] A Hangman Game using js played in the browser console: From a pre-defined array of words (Indian Cities in this case), a random word is chosen but the letters are not shown, only dashes (_) are shown, one dash for each letter of the word to be guessed. The user has to guess the name of city, one letter at a time. For each letter that the user guesses which is not in the word, a life is decremented and a hangman is drawn progressively. A user has five lives in total at the beginning of the game. This game has no frontend, it is played entirely in console. If you wish to play:
  1. Fork the branch
  2. Open browser then inspect the page and open the console
  4. Copy and paste local url of the html file on the browser
  5. Game will begin in the console, you can guess in the prompt window

Part b] A website that displays sport scores in real-time: We fetche data from football-api and load in onto the front-end. I have chosen the current Champions league (2023). Each card is for one match. The cards show the current score, date and time of the match. Currently, data of all UEFA Champions League 2023 is being fetched. In case the cards do not load, it means that either the API is down, or my daily request limit of 100 has been reached. You can try later in that case.
